## Layout
Building Blocks
CSS treats each HTML element as if it is in its
own box. This box will either be a block-level
box or an inline box. and that helps a lot when ur forming your webpage and trying to organize it the way you want since inline block elements tend to take a whole ling for them selves like paragraph, We have attributes in css to take care of that.

## Screen Sizes

not all users have the same screen that your creating you website on, While its impossible to make it show the same degree of colors and its density you can control the screen size and how its shows, Relative screen size that works with the size of the screen your website is opened on instead of having ur element organization fall apart the moment a useres opens ur page from a bigger screen or having the elements to hug each other really tight the moment ur website is opened from a phone
alwys keep in mind the diffrince in screen sizes between the useres and work based upon that, As instrcoutor razan always says work to makr things always dynamic a developer hates the fixed things.
