# Problem domain 
problem domain is a sticky subject, How far can you udnerstand the problem and solve it and how much intel you can gather on it are crucial to the coding procss, It should be a priority to understand everything from the user and trying to understand all of its aspects before writing a single line of code. 
confidince is good but too much of it can waste a lot of time and prjects 
To deal wtih the problem domain you can do things like simplyfing it as much as possible "Divide and counqure" kind of thing , the simpler the the thing the easier it is to deal with it. 


# Objects 
objects are like clusters of data that we handle using code, Anything can be an object and anything can be dealt with as just simple inputs of data. 
inside the object such data/variables are called properties and fucntions become knows as methods , They both help us describe the object were dealing with.

there is many ways to create an object and the most common one is literal notation. 

```
\\ declaring the object 
var hote l = {
name: 'Quay',
rooms: 40,
booked : 25,
checkAvailability: function() {
return this.rooms - this.booked;
}
}; 
```
