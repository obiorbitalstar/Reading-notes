# Lists ,Boxes, Loop

## Lists
Lists are used to organize how we view things and elements in the website and they can be seperated into three types of lists ;
- Ordered Lists: 
they are used to views items in an ordered way (hencing the name), the items are by default numbered  starting from 1 all the way to the last element. u can start an ordered list using the tag "<ol> </ol>" 
- Unordered Lists:
The unordered list is almost the same as the ordrerd list the diffrence is there is no systymatic way to veiw the items in this list but only shows with a dot or somthing next to it hencing its a list item, You can start an unordered list using the "<ul></ul>" tag.
- Definition Lists: 
Definition lists are used when there is more to be said about the item so every item will have a definition or some explination about it next to it, You can start the definition list using the "<dl></dl>" 

Ps: all lists can be used inside one another this operation is called " Nested lists " 



## Boxes 
CSS treats each HTML element as if it has its own box, You can use CSS to control the dimensions of a box, You can also control the borders, margin and padding for each box with CSS.

* We can control which elements to be viewed and which to be hiddin by utlizing the visibility properties.

using those boxes we can control how things are put togather in the site and make sure they dont cross each other using the padding feature ,
we can control where the element is viewed inside the site using the boxed and the margin feature.
css is big world and i dont have the ablitity to descripte it in a good way yet 



## LOOPS 
There is three kind of loops in Javascript  
- for 
- while 
- do while 

each sereve the same pourpose of doing the same code repetedly under a condtion andn once this condtion is broken or its value turns from true to fals the system breaks out of the loop.
since all 3 have the same porpuse what is the diffrence between them  you might ask ? 
well its simple(not really but a brother can dream) ,
The best use for the for loop is when you know how many times you want the code to be repeted (there is a fixed already knows number for it).
we use the While loop when we have no idea  or not sure when would the loop break .
do while is the same as the while but with the do while the code would be excuted at least once where in the normal while loop the code could be broken from the first loop. 

## IF statment and switch statment 
 like the loops( in a way ), the if statment and the switch statment dose the same thing in a way ,
 you have a bunch of cases that could be true or wrong and based on the truthiness or the falsiness of thsoe cases you want extra actions to be done. 

the diffrence between them is that the if-else statement "selects the execution of the statements based upon the evaluation of the expression in if statements". The switch statements "selects the execution of the statement often according to a keyboard command". (this paragrapgh was copied from the internet for the lack in the ablitlity to express my self about it) .
