# LINKS,LAYOUT , FUNCTIONS OBJECTS AND METHODS 

## links : 
links are what makes the browsing and the whole idea of web pages happen in a way 
wither its linking pages to each other from your own website using relative links or linking from your website to other websites using the " <a> </a> " tag the use of links is neccary in order for you site to work 
there is diffrent ways of linking and each one has its own sit of rules and values 
* internal links linking  your website pages with each other using realtive link (parent/grandfather/child/same/grandparent folder)
* links that redirect us to other webpages using the " <a> </a>" tag and a link to that said website 
and when you website is loaded with contect and you want it to be easier for the user to jump inside it you can use the id of specific tags to move him directly to that section of ur webpage or even a spicific section of other pages in ur site 

one more use of links is the "mailtio" attribute where it can open an emailing program and let u imiditly start compsing an email to an email you previously put.

## layout 
honsely i dont know what to write about this in an organized fashion. 
so every html page is a group of tags put togather in one file to look in a way 
how u put and magnage those tags in your file is the layout (the way you order your website elements), There is countless things to watch out for while deciding how to layout ur website 
first is if the tag that your going to use is considered inline or inline-block,
Inline-block takes space as much as its filled no more or less while inline takes a whole line for it self 
usualy we put the tags inside a div so things dont get messy 
and we utalize the ability to change how much each tag takes and out they are ordered beside each other (margin/padding..etc)
another thing to watch out for is that you need to keep in mind that your website will be veiwed on diffrent sizes and quality of screens so if it look all fine and dandy on your website it might not be the same when you open it in a diffrent device so you need to generalize your layout using features like (relative, absolute, or fixed positioning) 

PS: Designers keep pages within 960-1000 pixels wide,
and indicate what the site is about within the top 600
pixels (to demonstrate its relevance without scrolling) ,Grids help create professional and flexible designs.

## FUNCTIONS OBJECTS AND METHODS  

scripts are basiclly are means to meet and end , you dont just randomly write a script you need to determined its purpose before writing it like you want a code to type a line 5 times there is many ways to do that like putting it in a consol.log 5 times or using a for loop, There is always a better soultion ,The more u learn the better you soultion will be.
in coding we using somthing called object , basiclly for a program anything the world can be counted as an object with data realted to it and constructors to handel that said data,evem web browsers are programs built using objects, Its how they see the web pages they recive the html code then read it and if the browser has a compiler/interpreter it will render the page if it had a css file and load it for the user.
