# layout 
honsely i dont know what to write about this in an organized fashion. 
so every html page is a group of tags put togather in one file to look in a way 
how u put and magnage those tags in your file is the layout (the way you order your website elements), There is countless things to watch out for while deciding how to layout ur website 
first is if the tag that your going to use is considered inline or inline-block,
Inline-block takes space as much as its filled no more or less while inline takes a whole line for it self 
usualy we put the tags inside a div so things dont get messy 
and we utalize the ability to change how much each tag takes and out they are ordered beside each other (margin/padding..etc)
another thing to watch out for is that you need to keep in mind that your website will be veiwed on diffrent sizes and quality of screens so if it look all fine and dandy on your website it might not be the same when you open it in a diffrent device so you need to generalize your layout using features like (relative, absolute, or fixed positioning) 

PS: Designers keep pages within 960-1000 pixels wide,
and indicate what the site is about within the top 600
pixels (to demonstrate its relevance without scrolling) ,Grids help create professional and flexible designs.
